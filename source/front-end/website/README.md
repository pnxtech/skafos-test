# website

This project was built using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I also installed the material design UI component for aesthetic value.

Use `yarn start` to launch the website locally.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Updating the site
After making changes to the website run the `build-site.sh` script which called yarn build (for a release build) and installed the built website into the web-service public folder.
