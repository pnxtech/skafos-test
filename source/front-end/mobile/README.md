A Flutter-based mobile app

This app wasn't part of the original requirements.  After completing the test project, testing it, and deploying it, I wanted to keep playing with it by creating a simple mobile app.

This repo contains a flutter-based mobile application written in the Dart programming language.

Like the ReactJS website this project uses both async/await and Google's Material UI.
However, unlike the ReactJS site, this simple app doesn't maintain state by efficiently adding to an internal store.
