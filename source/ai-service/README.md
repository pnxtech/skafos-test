# ai-service
A Python Flask service exposing an API for Natural Language Processing.

## Usage
This service is launched via the project's [docker stack](../docker-stack/README.md).

I've chosen to use the `ubuntu:16.04` container image out of convenience but would likely use a lighter container in an actual production environment.
